Clinical electroencephalography (EEG) is an electrophysiological monitoring method used to record electrical activity of the brain. Clinical EEG is the most important investigation in the diagnosis and management of epilepsies and can also be used to evaluate other types of brain disorders. An EEG records the electrical activity along the scalp and measures spontaneous electrical activity of the brain. Unfortunately, the EEG signal is complex and inter-observer agreement for EEG interpretation is known to be only moderate. Such interpretations of EEG recordings are available in EEG reports. 

It has been shown that 71% of malpractice claims against neurologists arose from "an evident failure of communication by the neurologist" and that the majority of the claims resulted from deficient communication between the neurologist and the primary physician or other specialists; 62.5% of claims included diagnostic errors and that 41.7% involved errors in "ordering, interpreting, and reporting of diagnostic imaging, follow-through and reporting mechanisms." It is expected that these types of errors could be reduced, and communication could be improved by developing tools capable of automatically analyzing medical reports. Moreover, a recent Institute of Medicine Report advocated the need for decision-support tools operating on electronic health records for primary care and emergency room providers to manage referral steps for further evaluation and care of persons with epilepsy. In this project we explore the role of natural language processing for processing EEG reports to enable patient cohort retrieval, recover underspecified or missing information, and extract knowledge.
