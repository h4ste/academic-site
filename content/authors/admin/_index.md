Travis R. Goodwin is an Independent Research Scholar at the U.S. National Library of Medicine. His research interests include medical informatics, deep learning, natural language processing, and information retrieval. Specifically, his research focuses on modeling health and disease processes by developing deep learning-enhanced artificial intelligence approaches capable of harnessing a wide variety of data – in particular, data not typically used for predictive modeling. Specifically, Dr. Goodwin explores whether the information documented in *unstructured* parts of electronic health records (EHRs) (e.g., free-text narratives in discharge summaries, radiology reports, progress notes, etc.) can supplement or exceed the traditional information contained in *structured* (i.e., tabular) parts of the EHR (e.g., vital signs, chart data, laboratory data, etc.) by enabling more complete and robust data-driven models of disease processes and prognostication. 

He has developed deep neural networks for modeling the onset of hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP), acute kidney injuries (HAAKI), pressure injuries (HAPI), and anemia (HAA) based only on raw unstructured clinical texts (without disease-specific feature engineering). He is presently am working on preparing a public benchmark collection of extracted clinical text and time-series labels as well as public leaderboards to track the state and fairness of clinical language understanding in several clinical settings, including disease staging, clinical phenotyping, all-cause mortality prediction, and length-of-stay prediction.
