  As clinical data warehouses continue to grow, so, too, does the need for
  scalable data processing. 

  In this poster we explore the use of Apache Spark's distributed SQL engine for interacting with the MIMIC-III critical care database. We explore the impact of distributed data processing enabled using Apache SparkSQL, providing our software for loading MIMIC data into a persistent distributed database, as well as example applications and interactive Apache Zeppelin notebooks.
