  As clinical data warehouses continue to grow, so, too, does the need for scalable data processing. We explore the use of Apache Spark's distributed SQL engine for interacting with the MIMIC-III critical care database. We explore the impact of distributed data processing enabled using Apache SparkSQL, providing our software for loading MIMIC data into a persistent distributed database, as well as example applications and interactive Apache Zeppelin notebooks.
