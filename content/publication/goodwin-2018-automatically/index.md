abstract: As medical science continues to advance, health care professionals and researchers
  are increasingly turning to clinical trials to obtain evidence supporting best-practice
  treatment options. While clinical trial registries such as Clinical-Trials.gov aim
  to facilitate these needs, it has been shown that many trials in the registry do
  not contain links to their published results. To address this problem, we present
  NCT Link, a system for automatically linking registered clinical trials to published
  MEDLINE articles reporting their results. NCT Link incorporates state-of-the-art
  deep learning and information retrieval techniques by automatically learning a Deep
  Highway Network (DHN) that estimates the likelihood that a MEDLINE article reports
  the results of a clinical trial. Our experimental results indicate that NCT Link
  obtains 30%-58% improved performance over previously reported automatic systems,
  suggesting that NCT Link could become a valuable tool for health care providers
  seeking to deliver best-practice medical care informed by evidence of clinical trials
  as well as (a) researchers investigating selective publication and reporting of
  clinical trial outcomes, and (b) study designers seeking to avoid unnecessary duplication
  of research efforts.
