abstract: 'This paper describes the system created by the University of Texas at Dallas
  for contentbased medical record retrieval submitted to the TREC 2011 Medical Records
  Track. Our system builds a query by extracting keywords from a given topic using
  a Wikipedia-based approach. We use regular expressions to extract age, gender, and
  negation requirements. Each query is then expanded by relying on UMLS, SNOMED, Wikipedia,
  and PubMed co-occurrence data for retrieval. Four runs were submitted: two based
  on Lucene with varying scoring methods, and two based on a hybrid approach with
  varying negation detection techniques. Our highest scoring submission achieved a
  MAP score of 40.8.'
