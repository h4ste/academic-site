 abstract = {This paper describes the system created by the University of Texas at Dallas for contentbased medical record retrieval submitted to the TREC 2011 Medical Records Track. Our system builds a query by extracting keywords from a given topic using a Wikipedia-based approach. We use regular expressions to extract age, gender, and negation requirements. Each query is then expanded by relying on UMLS, SNOMED, Wikipedia, and PubMed co-occurrence data for retrieval. Four runs were submitted: two based on Lucene with varying scoring methods, and two based on a hybrid approach with varying negation detection techniques. Our highest scoring submission achieved a MAP score of 40.8.},
