abstract: The expanding clinical information provided by the advent of electronic
  medical records offers an exciting opportunity to substantially improve the quality
  of health care. By examining the clinical observations (such as diagnoses, risk
  factors, and medications) mentioned in longitudinal EMRs, we can use patients' medical
  chronologies to automatically predict the progression of their pathologies. In this
  paper, we present a novel probabilistic model which jointly learns how to (1)group
  patients based on the similarities between their clinical observations as well as
  how to (2) predict the way a new patient's clinical observations might evolve in
  the future. We show that our model can be used to not only track how a patient's
  clinical findings might change over time, but to also identify which patients are
  due for preventative visits. In addition, our model has the potential to improve
  the quality of over-all patient care in practice by predicting the most likely set
  of clinical observations at an arbitrary point in the future.
