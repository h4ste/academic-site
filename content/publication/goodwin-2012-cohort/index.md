abstract: This paper describes the updated system created by the University of Texas
  at Dallas for content-based medical record retrieval submitted to the TREC 2012
  Medical Records Track. Our system updates our work from the previous year by building
  a structured query for each cohort that captures the patientâ€™s age, gender, hospital
  status, and medical assertion information. Further, all keywords that encode any
  medical phenomena from the query are recursively decomposed before being expanded
  using knowledge from UMLS, SNOMED, Wikipedia, and PubMed co-occurrences. An initial
  ranking of hospital visits is then obtained using BM25 relevance on an interpolation
  of these decomposed keywords. Finally, hospital visits are re-ranked according to
  the constraints extracted in the structured query. Four runs were submitted, comparing
  pair-wise combinations of complete vs. shallow keyword decomposition and full vs.
  negation-only assertion processing. Our highest scoring submission achieved an infNDCG
  score of 0.426.
