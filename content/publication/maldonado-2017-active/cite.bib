 abstract = {The annotation of a large corpus of Electroencephalography (EEG) reports is a crucial step in the development of an EEG-specific patient cohort retrieval system. The annotation of multiple types of EEG-specific medical concepts, along with their polarity and modality, is challenging, especially when automatically performed on Big Data. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework which combines the advantages of active and deep learning while producing annotations that capture a variety of attributes of medical concepts. Results obtained through our novel framework show great promise.},
