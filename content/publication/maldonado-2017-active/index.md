abstract: The annotation of a large corpus of Electroencephalography (EEG) reports
  is a crucial step in the development of an EEG-specific patient cohort retrieval
  system. The annotation of multiple types of EEG-specific medical concepts, along
  with their polarity and modality, is challenging, especially when automatically
  performed on Big Data. To address this challenge, we present a novel framework which
  combines the advantages of active and deep learning while producing annotations
  that capture a variety of attributes of medical concepts. Results obtained through
  our novel framework show great promise.
