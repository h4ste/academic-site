abstract: 'Electronic Operative Notes are generated after surgical procedures for
  documentation and billing. These operative notes, like many other Electronic Medical
  Records (EMRs) have the potential of an important secondary use: they can enable
  surgical clinical research aimed at improving evidence-based medical practice. Recognizing
  surgical techniques by capturing the structure of a surgical procedure requires
  the semantic processing and discourse understanding of operative notes. Identifying
  only predicates pertaining to surgical actions does not explain the various possible
  surgical scripts. Similarly, recognizing all actions and observations pertaining
  to a surgical step cannot be performed without taking into account discourse structure.
  In this paper we show how combining both forms of clinical language processing leads
  to learning the structure of surgical procedures. Experimental results on two large
  sets of operative notes show promising results.'
