abstract: In this paper, we describe the system designed for the TREC 2017 Precision
  Medicine track by the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) Human Language Technology
  Research Institute (HLTRI). Our system incorporates an aspect-based retrieval paradigm
  wherein each of the four structured components of the topic is cast as a separate
  aspect, along with two “hidden” aspects encoding the need that retrieved documents
  be within the domain of precision medicine and that retrieved documents have a focus
  on treatment. To this end, we construct knowledge graph encoding the relationships
  between drugs, genes, and mutations. Our experiments reveal that the aspect-based
  approach leads to improved quality of retrieved scientific articles and clinical
  trials.
