 abstract = {In this paper, we describe the system designed for the TREC 2017 Precision Medicine track by the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) Human Language Technology Research Institute (HLTRI). Our system incorporates an aspect-based retrieval paradigm wherein each of the four structured components of the topic is cast as a separate aspect, along with two “hidden” aspects encoding the need that retrieved documents be within the domain of precision medicine and that retrieved documents have a focus on treatment. To this end, we construct knowledge graph encoding the relationships between drugs, genes, and mutations. Our experiments reveal that the aspect-based approach leads to improved quality of retrieved scientific articles and clinical trials.},
