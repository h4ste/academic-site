abstract: While biomedical ontologies have traditionally been used to guide the identification
  of concepts or relations in biomedical data, recent advances in deep learning are
  able to capture high-quality knowledge from textual data and represent it in graphical
  structures. As opposed to the top-down methodology used in the generation of ontologies,
  which starts with the principled design of the upper ontology, the bottom-up methodology
  enabled by deep learning encodes the likelihood that concepts share certain relations,
  as evidenced by data. In this paper, we present a knowledge representation produced
  by deep learning methods, called Medical Knowledge Embeddings (MKE), that encode
  medical concepts related to the study of epilepsy and the relations between them.
  Many of the epilepsy-relevant medical concepts from MKE are not yet available in
  existing biomedical ontologies, but are mentioned in vast collections of epilepsy-related
  medical records which also imply their relationships. The evaluation of the MKE
  indicates high accuracy of the medical concepts automatically identified from clinical
  text as well as promising results in terms of correctness and completeness of relations
  produced by deep learning.
