abstract: Hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the second most common nosocomial infection
  in the ICU and costs an estimated $3.1 billion annually. The ability to predict
  HAP could improve patient outcomes and reduce costs. Traditional pneumonia risk
  prediction models rely on a small number of hand-chosen signs and symptoms and have
  been shown to poorly discriminate between low and high risk individuals. Consequently,
  we wanted to investigate whether modern data-driven techniques applied to respective
  pneumonia cohorts could provide more robust and discriminative prognostication of
  pneumonia risk. In this paper we present a deep learning system for predicting imminent
  pneumonia risk one or more days into the future using clinical observations documented
  in ICU notes for an at-risk population (n = 1, 467). We show how the system can
  be trained without direct supervision or feature engineering from sparse, noisy,
  and limited data to predict future pneumonia risk with 96% Sensitivity, 72% AUC,
  and 80% F1-measure, outperforming SVM approaches using the same features by 20%
  Accuracy (relative; 12% absolute).
