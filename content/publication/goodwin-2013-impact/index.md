abstract: Retrieving relevant patient cohorts has the potential to accelerate clinical
  research. Recent evaluations have shown promising results, but also relevance measures
  that still need to be improved. To address the challenge of better modelling hospital
  visit relevance, we considered the impact of two forms of medical knowledge on the
  quality of patient cohorts. First, we automatically identified three types of medical
  concepts and, second, we asserted their belief values. This allowed us to perform
  experiments that capture the impact of incorporating knowledge of belief values
  within a retrieval system for identifying hospital visits corresponding to patient
  cohorts. We show that this approach generates a 149% increase for inferred average
  precision, a 36.5% increase of NDCG, and a 207% increase to the precision of the
  first ten returned documents.
