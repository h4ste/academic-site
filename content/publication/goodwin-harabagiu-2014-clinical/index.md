abstract: Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) encode an extraordinary amount of medical
  knowledge. Collecting and interpreting this knowledge, however, belies a significant
  level of clinical understanding. Automatically capturing the clinical information
  is crucial for performing comparative effectiveness research. In this paper, we
  present a data-driven approach to model semantic dependencies between medical concepts,
  qualified by the beliefs of physicians. The dependencies, captured in a patient
  cohort graph of clinical pictures and therapies is further refined into a probabilistic
  graphical model which enables efficient inference of patient-centered treatment
  or test recommendations (based on probabilities). To perform inference on the graphical
  model, we describe a technique of smoothing the conditional likelihood of medical
  concepts by their semantically-similar belief values. The experimental results,
  as compared against clinical guidelines are very promising.
