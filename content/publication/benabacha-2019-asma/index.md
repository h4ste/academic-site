abstract: This paper addresses the task of answering consumer health questions about
  medications. To better understand the challenge and needs in terms of methods and
  resources, we first introduce a gold standard corpus for Medication Question Answering
  created using real consumer questions. The gold standard consists of six hundred
  and seventy-four question-answer pairs with annotations of the question focus and
  type and the answer source. We first present the manual annotation and answering
  process. In the second part of this paper, we test the performance of recurrent
  and convolutional neural networks in question type identification and focus recognition.
  Finally, we discuss the research insights from both the dataset creation process
  and our experiments. This study provides new resources and experiments on answering
  consumers’ medication questions and discusses the limitations and directions for
  future research efforts.
