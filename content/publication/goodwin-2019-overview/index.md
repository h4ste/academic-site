abstract: 'This paper describes the Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction from Drug Labels
  Track, part of the 2019 Text Analysis Conference (TAC). Participants were provided
  with an annotated set of interactionsrelated sections of drug labels and challenged
  with: (1) extracting mentions of the precipitants and effects of drug-drug interactions
  at the sentence level; (2) identifying(typed) relations between interacting substances;
  (3) normalizing mentions and relations to several standard terminologies; and (4)
  determining the unique set of drug-drug interactions across all provided sections
  of a drug label. Four teams submitted at least one run, with 10 submissions in total.'
