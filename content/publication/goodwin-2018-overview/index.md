abstract: 'This paper describes the Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction from Drug Labels
  Track, part of the 2018 Text Analysis Conference (TAC). Participants were provided
  with an annotated set of interactionsrelated sections of drug labels and challenged
  with: (1) extracting mentions of the precipitants, triggers and effects of drug-drug
  interactions at sentence level; (2) identifying relations between interacting substances
  and their types; (3) normalizing mentions and relations to several standard terminologies;
  and (4) determining the unique set of drug-drug interactions across all provided
  sections of a drug label. Eight teams submitted at least one run, with 26 submissions
  in total.'
