abstract: In this paper, we describe the system designed for the TREC 2018 Precision
  Medicine track by the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) Human Language Technology
  Research Institute (HLTRI). Our system extends the system submitted for the 2017
  track which incorporates an aspect-based retrieval paradigm wherein each of the
  four structured components of the topic is cast as a separate aspect, along with
  two “hidden” aspects encoding the need that retrieved documents be within the domain
  of precision medicine and that retrieved documents have a focus on treatment. For
  the 2018 system, in addition to the aspect-based retrieval, we incorporated learning-to-rank
  (L2R). Our experiments show that our L2R approach leads to improved quality of retrieved
  clinical trials, but degrades performance for scientific articles.
