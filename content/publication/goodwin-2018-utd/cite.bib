 abstract = {In this paper, we describe the system designed for the TREC 2018 Precision Medicine track by the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) Human Language Technology Research Institute (HLTRI). Our system extends the system submitted for the 2017 track which incorporates an aspect-based retrieval paradigm wherein each of the four structured components of the topic is cast as a separate aspect, along with two “hidden” aspects encoding the need that retrieved documents be within the domain of precision medicine and that retrieved documents have a focus on treatment. For the 2018 system, in addition to the aspect-based retrieval, we incorporated learning-to-rank (L2R). Our experiments show that our L2R approach leads to improved quality of retrieved clinical trials, but degrades performance for scientific articles.},
